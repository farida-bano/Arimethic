Arithmetic operators are symbols used to perform mathematical operations on one or more operands. These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). They work with numeric data types to perform operations like adding two numbers together, subtracting one number from another, multiplying numbers, etc.

Unary operators, on the other hand, operate on a single operand. They can perform various operations such as changing the sign of a number, incrementing or decrementing a value by one, or performing logical negation. Unary operators include unary plus (+), unary negation (-), increment (++), and decrement (--), among others.

Here's a brief explanation of each:

Arithmetic Operators:

Addition (+): Adds two operands together.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second.
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second.
Unary Operators:

Unary Plus (+): Converts an operand into a number. It's primarily used to explicitly indicate positive numbers.
Unary Negation (-): Negates its operand, changing positive numbers to negative and vice versa.
Increment (++): Increases the value of its operand by 1. It can be used as a postfix (x++) or a prefix (++x).
Decrement (--): Decreases the value of its operand by 1. Like increment, it can be used as a postfix (x--) or a prefix (--x).
These operators are fundamental in programming languages for performing arithmetic operations and manipulating values.
